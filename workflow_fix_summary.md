# GitHub Actions Workflow Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The "Build and Test" workflow was stuck in pending state while the "CI" workflow completed successfully. This was causing the Build and Test #86 to remain pending for over 8 minutes.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was identified in the `build.yml` workflow where several jobs could potentially hang indefinitely:

1. **increment-version job**: The `update-version.sh` script has complex Git retry logic that could hang during push operations
2. **build jobs**: Build processes could hang without proper timeouts
3. **concurrency settings**: Multiple workflow runs could queue up causing pending states

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Added Timeouts to Critical Jobs
- **increment-version**: Added `timeout-minutes: 10`
- **build-python-package**: Added `timeout-minutes: 20`
- **build-cross-platform**: Added `timeout-minutes: 45`
- **create-staging-release**: Added `timeout-minutes: 15`

### 2. Updated Concurrency Settings
- Changed `cancel-in-progress` from `false` to `true`
- This prevents workflow queuing and allows newer runs to cancel older ones

## Files Modified
- `.github/workflows/build.yml`: Added timeouts and updated concurrency settings

## Expected Results
1. Build and Test workflows will no longer hang indefinitely
2. Jobs will fail gracefully with timeout errors instead of pending forever
3. Newer workflow runs will cancel older ones to prevent queuing
4. Overall workflow reliability and predictability improved

## Testing Recommendations
1. Monitor the next few workflow runs to ensure timeouts are appropriate
2. Adjust timeout values if needed based on actual build times
3. Verify that the increment-version job completes within the 10-minute timeout

## Additional Notes
The CI workflow was already completing successfully, so the issue was specifically in the Build and Test workflow dependency chain. These fixes address the hanging job issue while maintaining the existing workflow logic and dependencies.
