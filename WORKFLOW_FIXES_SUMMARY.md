# R2MIDI CI/CD Workflow Fixes Summary

## Files Updated

### 1. `/Users/tirane/Desktop/r2midi/.github/scripts/update-version.sh`
**Status**: ✅ Updated and has execute permissions (755)

**Key improvements**:
- Added `ensure_clean_working_tree()` function to prevent "unstaged changes" errors
- Improved conflict resolution for version files
- Better retry logic with exponential backoff
- Automatic staging and committing of uncommitted changes before rebase

### 2. `/Users/tirane/Desktop/r2midi/.github/workflows/build.yml`
**Status**: ✅ Updated

**Key improvements**:
- Added concurrency control to prevent race conditions
- Proper sequential execution: CI → Version Increment → Build → Release
- Skip conditions check at the beginning to handle `[skip ci]` commits
- All build jobs wait for version increment and checkout the updated commit
- Version increment only happens after successful CI tests

### 3. `/Users/tirane/Desktop/r2midi/.github/scripts/prepare-platform-artifacts.sh`
**Status**: ✅ Created (needs execute permissions)

**Purpose**: Properly packages build artifacts for each platform
**Features**:
- Platform-specific packaging logic
- Multiple compression format support
- Error handling and validation

## How to Apply Permissions

Run this command to make the new script executable:
```bash
chmod +x /Users/tirane/Desktop/r2midi/.github/scripts/prepare-platform-artifacts.sh
```

Or run the helper script:
```bash
chmod +x /Users/tirane/Desktop/r2midi/.github/scripts/set-permissions.sh
/Users/tirane/Desktop/r2midi/.github/scripts/set-permissions.sh
```

## Key Changes Summary

1. **Fixed "unstaged changes" error**: The update-version.sh now ensures a clean working tree before any git operations.

2. **Prevented concurrent execution**: Added concurrency group to build.yml to prevent multiple workflow runs on the same branch.

3. **Proper execution order**: 
   - CI tests run first
   - Version increment only happens after successful CI
   - Builds wait for version increment to complete
   - All builds use the version-bumped commit

4. **Better error handling**: Improved retry logic with exponential backoff and automatic conflict resolution for version files.

5. **Skip handling**: Version bump commits with `[skip ci]` will properly skip the entire workflow.

## Workflow Execution Flow

```
Push to master
    ↓
Check skip conditions
    ↓
Run CI tests
    ↓
[If CI passes and on master]
Increment version (with [skip ci])
    ↓
Build all platforms (using new version)
    ↓
Create staging release
```

## Testing

After applying these changes:
1. Push a commit to master
2. Watch the Actions tab - you should see:
   - First run: CI → Version Increment → Builds → Release
   - No second run due to `[skip ci]` in version commit
3. Version should increment only once
4. All builds should use the new version number

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:
1. Check the Actions logs for any error messages
2. Ensure all scripts have execute permissions
3. Verify GitHub token has write permissions
4. Check if there are any branch protection rules preventing pushes
