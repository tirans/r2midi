    <!-- 
    Note: The following entitlements have been removed as they are not compatible 
    with ad-hoc signing and require proper Developer ID Application certificates:
    
    - com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation
    - com.apple.security.cs.allow-jit
    - com.apple.security.cs.allow-unsigned-executable-memory
    
    These entitlements are typically needed for:
    - JIT compilation (PyQt6, some Python extensions)
    - Loading unsigned libraries
    - Dynamic code generation
    
    If you have proper Developer ID Application certificates available during the build,
    you can switch back to using "entitlements.plist" which includes these entitlements.
