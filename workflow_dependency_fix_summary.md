# GitHub Actions Workflow Dependency Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The "Build and Test" workflow CI stage completed successfully, but the build stage didn't start. This was happening because build jobs were waiting for the `increment-version` job to complete, but on pull requests, the `increment-version` job doesn't run at all.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the workflow dependency logic in `.github/workflows/build.yml`:

1. **Workflow triggers**: The workflow runs on both `push` to master and `pull_request` to master
2. **increment-version job**: Only runs when `should_increment == 'true'`, which only happens on pushes to master (not PRs)
3. **Build jobs dependency**: All build jobs depend on `increment-version` and check if it's either 'success' OR 'skipped'
4. **The problem**: When `increment-version` doesn't run at all (on PRs), its result is neither 'success' nor 'skipped' - it's undefined/cancelled

This caused build jobs to wait indefinitely for a condition that would never be met on pull requests.

## Fixes Implemented

### Updated Build Job Conditions
Modified the `if` conditions for all build jobs to handle the case where `increment-version` doesn't run:

**Before:**
```yaml
if: |
  always() && 
  needs.check-skip.outputs.should_skip != 'true' && 
  needs.ci.result == 'success' &&
  (needs.increment-version.result == 'success' || needs.increment-version.result == 'skipped')
```

**After:**
```yaml
if: |
  always() && 
  needs.check-skip.outputs.should_skip != 'true' && 
  needs.ci.result == 'success' &&
  (needs.increment-version.result == 'success' || needs.increment-version.result == 'skipped' || needs.check-skip.outputs.should_increment != 'true')
```

### Jobs Fixed
1. **build-python-package**: Now runs on PRs after CI completes
2. **build-cross-platform**: Now runs on PRs after CI completes  
3. **build-macos**: Now runs on PRs after CI completes

### Jobs Left Unchanged
- **create-staging-release**: Correctly configured to only run on master pushes when version is incremented

## Expected Results
1. **Pull Requests**: CI completes → Build jobs start immediately (no version increment needed)
2. **Master Pushes**: CI completes → Version increments → Build jobs start with new version
3. **No more pending builds**: Build jobs will start after CI completion regardless of trigger type

## Files Modified
- `.github/workflows/build.yml`: Updated build job conditions

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test with a pull request to verify build jobs start after CI completion
2. Test with a master push to verify version increment → build flow still works
3. Monitor workflow runs to ensure no jobs get stuck in pending state

## Technical Details
The fix adds the condition `needs.check-skip.outputs.should_increment != 'true'` which means build jobs will run when increment-version is not supposed to run (like on PRs), in addition to the existing conditions for when it succeeds or is skipped.
