# Local PKG Testing Solution - Summary

## What Was Created

I've created a comprehensive local testing solution for your macOS PKG build process that allows you to test the entire build pipeline locally before pushing to GitHub Actions.

### 📁 Files Created

1. **`scripts/test_pkg_build_locally.sh`** - Main testing script (374 lines)
   - Comprehensive local PKG build testing script
   - Mimics the GitHub Actions workflow
   - Includes error handling, colored output, and validation
   - Supports both development and production builds

2. **`LOCAL_PKG_TESTING.md`** - Complete documentation (341 lines)
   - Step-by-step setup instructions
   - Usage examples and troubleshooting guide
   - Prerequisites and environment setup
   - Advanced usage scenarios

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Make the script executable (already done)
chmod +x scripts/test_pkg_build_locally.sh

# Run a basic test build
./scripts/test_pkg_build_locally.sh

# Run with specific version and build type
./scripts/test_pkg_build_locally.sh 1.0.0 production
```

## 🔧 What the Script Does

The local testing script replicates your GitHub Actions workflow:

1. **Prerequisites Check** ✅
   - Verifies macOS, Python, briefcase, and build tools
   - Checks for missing dependencies with installation instructions

2. **Apple Developer Setup** ✅
   - Detects available certificates in keychain
   - Checks for both Application and Installer certificates
   - Validates Apple credentials for notarization

3. **Certificate Configuration** ✅
   - Uses local certificate files if available
   - Falls back to system keychain certificates
   - Runs the existing certificate setup scripts

4. **Signing Configuration** ✅
   - Executes your existing signing configuration scripts
   - Selects appropriate entitlements based on certificate availability
   - Updates pyproject.toml automatically

5. **Application Building** ✅
   - Builds both server and client apps with briefcase
   - Uses the same configuration as GitHub Actions
   - Includes error handling and progress reporting

6. **PKG Creation** ✅
   - Creates PKG installers for both applications
   - Uses full signing/notarization if credentials available
   - Falls back to unsigned PKG for testing

7. **Validation** ✅
   - Verifies created PKG files
   - Checks signatures and file sizes
   - Reports build artifacts and locations

## 💡 Key Features

### Smart Certificate Detection
- Automatically detects available certificates
- Provides clear guidance on certificate requirements
- Supports both local files and keychain certificates

### Flexible Build Options
- Development builds (unsigned, fast)
- Production builds (signed, notarized)
- Custom versions and build types

### Comprehensive Error Handling
- Clear error messages with solutions
- Troubleshooting guidance for common issues
- Integration with existing fix scripts

### Output Validation
- Verifies PKG creation and signing
- Reports file sizes and locations
- Checks application bundles

## 📋 Prerequisites

### Required (Automatically Checked)
- macOS (any recent version)
- Python 3.12+
- Briefcase (`pip install briefcase`)
- Xcode Command Line Tools

### Optional (For Production Builds)
- Apple Developer Account
- Developer ID Application Certificate
- Developer ID Installer Certificate
- Apple ID credentials for notarization

## 🎯 Usage Scenarios

### 1. Development Testing
```bash
# Quick test without signing
./scripts/test_pkg_build_locally.sh
```

### 2. Production Validation
```bash
# Set Apple credentials
export APPLE_ID="your-apple-id@example.com"
export APPLE_ID_PASSWORD="your-app-specific-password"
export APPLE_TEAM_ID="YOUR_TEAM_ID"

# Run production build
./scripts/test_pkg_build_locally.sh 1.0.0 production
```

### 3. CI/CD Integration
```bash
# Use in local CI scripts
./scripts/test_pkg_build_locally.sh $(git describe --tags) staging
```

## 🔍 Expected Output

### Successful Build

## 🛠️ Integration with Existing Infrastructure

The script seamlessly integrates with your existing build infrastructure:

- **Uses existing scripts**: `configure_briefcase_signing.py`, `select_entitlements.py`
- **Leverages certificate setup**: `.github/scripts/setup-certificates.sh`
- **Follows same workflow**: Mirrors GitHub Actions build process
- **Compatible with fixes**: Works with `fix_macos_signing.py`

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

The script includes comprehensive error handling and troubleshooting:

### Common Issues Covered
1. Missing dependencies with installation instructions
2. Certificate configuration problems
3. Briefcase build failures
4. Code signing errors
5. PKG creation issues

### Debug Options
```bash
# Check certificates manually
security find-identity -v -p codesigning

# Test individual components
python scripts/configure_briefcase_signing.py
python scripts/select_entitlements.py

# Fix signing issues
python scripts/fix_macos_signing.py
```
