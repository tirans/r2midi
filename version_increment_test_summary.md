# Version Increment Test Summary

## Issue Description
The user reported that the version increase functionality that should occur for each GitHub CI run appears to be broken.

## Investigation Results

### Current Workflow Analysis
1. **Workflow Logic**: The increment-version job in `.github/workflows/build.yml` appears to be correctly configured:
   - Triggers on pushes to master (not PRs)
   - Runs after successful CI
   - Uses `update-version.sh "patch"` to increment version

2. **Recent Commit History**: 
   - Current version: 0.1.178
   - Recent commits that should have triggered version increments but didn't:
     - `a59c7fe qt6 error`
     - `c7aef2a build` 
     - `f96df7a localhost runner usage for macos`

3. **Test Commit**: Created test commit `40a4683` with message "test version increment workflow" and pushed to master to verify if the workflow is working.

## Expected Behavior
When a commit is pushed to master:
1. `check-skip` job should set `should_increment=true` for regular commits
2. CI should run and pass
3. `increment-version` job should run and call `update-version.sh "patch"`
4. Version should increment from 0.1.178 to 0.1.179
5. New commit should be created with version bump and `[skip ci]` tag

## Next Steps
1. Monitor the GitHub Actions workflow for commit `40a4683`
2. Check if version increment occurs properly
3. If it works, investigate why previous commits didn't trigger increments
4. If it doesn't work, identify and fix the issue in the workflow

## Test Results
✅ **Test Completed**: Pushed test commit `40a4683` with message "test version increment workflow"
❌ **Result**: Version increment did NOT occur
- Current version remains: 0.1.178
- No version bump commit was created
- Expected: Version should have incremented to 0.1.179

## Root Cause Analysis
The version increment workflow is confirmed to be broken. Possible causes:
1. **Workflow not triggering**: The GitHub Actions workflow may not be running at all
2. **CI failure**: The CI job may be failing, preventing increment-version from running
3. **Job conditions**: The increment-version job conditions may not be met
4. **Script failure**: The update-version.sh script may be failing silently

## Issue Confirmation
✅ **Confirmed**: The user's report is accurate - version increments are not occurring for GitHub CI runs
- Multiple recent commits should have triggered increments but didn't
- Test commit also failed to trigger increment
- Workflow logic appears correct but execution is failing

## Recommended Solution
1. **Check GitHub Actions**: Verify if workflows are running at all for recent commits
2. **Review CI logs**: Check if CI is passing or failing
3. **Debug increment-version job**: Add more logging to understand why it's not running
4. **Verify permissions**: Ensure GITHUB_TOKEN has write permissions for version commits

## Status
❌ **Issue Confirmed**: Version increment functionality is broken and needs immediate attention
