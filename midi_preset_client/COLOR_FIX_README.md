# MIDI Preset Client - UI Color Fix Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Color Application in preset_panel.py

- **Fixed background color application**: Modified the code to create fresh QColor instances to ensure colors are properly applied
- **Improved text contrast**: Enhanced the brightness calculation to ensure text is always readable against background colors
- **Added data role storage**: Store colors using Qt.ItemDataRole to ensure persistence

### 2. Custom Item Delegate

- **Created PresetItemDelegate class**: A custom delegate that handles item painting to ensure category colors are always visible
- **Selection preservation**: Selection is shown as a border instead of filling to preserve the background color
- **Hover effects**: Added subtle hover effects that don't override the category colors

### 3. Updated Predefined Colors

- **More vibrant palette**: Replaced light pastel colors with more vibrant, distinguishable colors
- **Extended palette**: Added 20 predefined colors to handle more categories
- **Better contrast**: Selected colors that work well with both black and white text

### 4. Theme Conflict Resolution

- **Removed conflicting styles**: Removed QListWidget item styles that were overriding category colors
- **Custom painting**: Use custom delegate instead of stylesheets to ensure colors are preserved

### 5. Test Utility

- **Created test_colors.py**: A utility script to view and clear category colors for testing

## How It Works

1. Each preset category is assigned a unique background color
2. Text color is automatically calculated based on background brightness
3. The custom delegate ensures colors are painted correctly regardless of theme
4. Selection is shown as a colored border to preserve the background color

## Testing

To test the changes:

1. Run the test utility to clear existing colors (optional):
   ```bash
   python test_colors.py
   ```
   Choose option 2 to clear colors and force regeneration.

2. Run your MIDI preset client application

3. The presets should now display with their category background colors:
   - Each category will have a distinct, vibrant background color
   - Text will be either black or white for optimal contrast
   - Selected items will show a blue border while maintaining their background color

## Troubleshooting

If colors are not showing:

1. Clear the saved colors using the test script
2. Check that no external themes are overriding the styles
3. Ensure the application is restarted after changes

The category colors are saved in: `~/.r2midi_category_colors.json`
