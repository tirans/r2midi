## Installation

Available on PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/r2midi or follow the instructions below.

### Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyQt6
- httpx
- psutil
- [SendMIDI](https://github.com/gbevin/SendMIDI) command-line tool
- MIDI devices connected to your computer

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tirans/r2midi.git
   cd r2midi
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Or using the pyproject.toml:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```
PORT=7777  # The port for the API server (default: 7777)
```

### Application Configuration

Configuration is stored in `~/.r2midi_config.json` with the following options:

```json
{
    "server_url": "http://localhost:7777",
    "cache_timeout": 300,
    "dark_mode": false,
    "enable_favorites": true,
    "enable_search": true,
    "enable_keyboard_shortcuts": true,
    "debounce_delay_ms": 300,
    "max_patches_display": 1000
}
```

### Device Configuration

Device definitions are stored as JSON files in the `devices` folder. Each device file should follow this format:

```json
{
  "name": "Device Name",
  "midi_ports": {
    "main": "MIDI Port Name",
    "alternate": "Alternative MIDI Port Name"
  },
  "midi_channels": {
    "main": 1,
    "alternate": 2
  },
  "presets": [
    {
      "preset_name": "Preset 1",
      "category": "Category",
      "characters": ["warm", "bright"],
      "cc_0": 0,
      "pgm": 1
    },
    {
      "preset_name": "Preset 2",
      "category": "Another Category",
      "characters": ["dark", "deep"],
      "cc_0": 0,
      "pgm": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

An example device file for the Expressivee Osmose is included in the `devices` folder.

## Usage

### Starting the Application

Run the main application:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will:
1. Start the API server on the configured port (default: 7777)
2. Scan for connected MIDI devices
3. Launch the GUI client

### Using the GUI

The GUI is divided into two main panels:

#### Device Panel (Top)

- **MIDI Output Port**: Select the MIDI port to send commands to
- **MIDI Channel**: Select the MIDI channel (1-16)
- **Sequencer Port**: Optionally select a secondary port to send the same commands to (useful for recording in a DAW)

#### Patch Panel (Bottom)

- Browse patches by category
- Search for patches by name
- Select a patch to send to the device
- Mark favorites for quick access
- Filter by characteristics or categories

#### Sending MIDI Commands

1. Select a MIDI output port and channel in the Device Panel
2. Select a patch in the Patch Panel
3. Click the "Send MIDI" button or press Enter to send the program change to your device

### API Endpoints

The application provides a REST API that can be used by other applications:

- `GET /devices` - Get a list of all devices
- `GET /patches` - Get a list of all patches
- `GET /midi_port` - Get a list of available MIDI ports
- `POST /preset` - Send a preset to a MIDI port/channel

Example API usage with curl:

```bash
# Get all devices
curl http://localhost:7777/devices

# Get all patches
curl http://localhost:7777/patches

# Get MIDI ports
curl http://localhost:7777/midi_port

# Send a preset
curl -X POST http://localhost:7777/preset \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"preset_name": "Preset Name", "midi_port": "MIDI Port Name", "midi_channel": 1}'
```

## Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
# Install test dependencies
pip install -e ".[test]"

# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific test modules
python -m pytest tests/test_enhanced_functionality.py -v
python -m pytest tests/test_comprehensive_features.py -v

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=midi_patch_client --cov-report=html
```

## Performance

### Benchmarks
- **Cache Hit Rate**: >90% for repeated operations
- **API Response Time**: <100ms with caching (vs 500ms+ without)
- **UI Responsiveness**: <16ms frame time (60+ FPS)
- **Memory Usage**: ~50MB baseline, ~100MB with 1000+ patches

### Optimization Tips
1. Enable caching in preferences (default: on)
2. Adjust debounce delay for your network speed
3. Use lazy loading for large patch collections
4. Enable performance monitoring in debug mode

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No MIDI devices detected**
   - Check that your MIDI devices are connected and powered on
   - Some devices may require specific drivers
   - Verify MIDI port names in the device configuration

2. **UI client fails to start**
   - Check the logs in the `logs` directory for error messages
   - Ensure PyQt6 is properly installed
   - Verify that the API server is running

3. **Server Connection Failed**
   - Check server is running on configured port
   - Verify firewall settings
   - Check server URL in preferences

4. **Patches Not Loading**
   - Ensure manufacturer and device are selected
   - Check server logs for errors
   - Try refreshing data (F5)

5. **High Memory Usage**
   - Reduce max_patches_display in config
   - Clear cache in preferences
   - Disable debug mode

### Logs

Logs are stored in the `logs` directory:
- `main.log` - Main application logs
- `device_manager.log` - Device manager logs
- `midi_utils.log` - MIDI utility logs
- `ui_launcher.log` - UI launcher logs
- `uvicorn.log` - Web server logs
- `all.log` - Combined logs from all components

## Version Management

The application version is stored in `version.py` and is automatically incremented on each push to the master branch using GitHub Actions.

### How Version Incrementing Works

The version incrementing is handled by the GitHub Actions workflow defined in `.github/workflows/python-package.yml`. When code is pushed to the master branch, the workflow:

1. Builds and tests the application
2. Increments the patch version (the third number in the version)
3. Updates both `version.py` and `pyproject.toml` with the new version
4. Commits and pushes the version changes back to the repository
5. Creates a GitHub release with the new version
6. Publishes the package to PyPI

For example, if the current version is `0.1.0`, after a push to master it will be `0.1.1`.

### Manual Version Updates

For major or minor version updates (first or second number), manually edit the `version.py` and `pyproject.toml` files before pushing to master. The GitHub Actions workflow will still handle creating the release and publishing to PyPI.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a Pull Request.

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Add tests for new functionality
4. Ensure all tests pass
5. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
6. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
7. Open a Pull Request

**Note**: You don't need to worry about incrementing the version number. This is handled automatically by GitHub Actions when your changes are merged to the master branch.
