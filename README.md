## Installation

R2MIDI can be installed in multiple ways:

### Pre-built Executables

Download the latest pre-built executable for your platform from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/tirans/r2midi/releases) page:

- **Windows**: Download `r2midi-windows.exe`
- **macOS**: Download `r2midi-macos`
- **Linux**: Download `r2midi-linux`

The executables are self-contained and don't require Python or any dependencies to be installed.

### PyPI Installation

Available on PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/r2midi

```bash
pip install r2midi
r2midi
```

### Manual Installation

#### Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyQt6
- httpx
- psutil
- [SendMIDI](https://github.com/gbevin/SendMIDI) command-line tool
- MIDI devices connected to your computer

#### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tirans/r2midi.git
   cd r2midi
   ```

2. Initialize and update the midi-presets submodule:
   ```bash
   git submodule init
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

   If you encounter issues with the submodule, you can also manually clone it:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tirans/midi-presets.git midi-presets
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Or using the pyproject.toml:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```
PORT=7777  # The port for the API server (default: 7777)
```

### Application Configuration

Configuration is stored in `~/.r2midi_config.json` with the following options:

```json
{
    "server_url": "http://localhost:7777",
    "cache_timeout": 3600,
    "dark_mode": false,
    "enable_favorites": true,
    "enable_search": true,
    "enable_keyboard_shortcuts": true,
    "debounce_delay_ms": 300,
    "max_presets_display": 1000,
    "sync_enabled": true
}
```

The `sync_enabled` option controls whether the application syncs with remote repositories. Set to `false` to enable offline mode.

### Device Configuration

Device definitions are stored as JSON files in the `devices` folder. Each device file should follow this format:

```json
{
  "name": "Device Name",
  "midi_ports": {
    "main": "MIDI Port Name",
    "alternate": "Alternative MIDI Port Name"
  },
  "midi_channels": {
    "main": 1,
    "alternate": 2
  },
  "presets": [
    {
      "preset_name": "Preset 1",
      "category": "Category",
      "characters": ["warm", "bright"],
      "cc_0": 0,
      "pgm": 1
    },
    {
      "preset_name": "Preset 2",
      "category": "Another Category",
      "characters": ["dark", "deep"],
      "cc_0": 0,
      "pgm": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

An example device file for the Expressivee Osmose is included in the `devices` folder.

## Usage

### Starting the Application

Run the main application:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will:
1. Start the API server on the configured port (default: 7777)
2. Scan for connected MIDI devices
3. Launch the GUI client

### Using the GUI

The GUI is divided into two main panels:

#### Device Panel (Top)

- **MIDI Output Port**: Select the MIDI port to send commands to
- **MIDI Channel**: Select the MIDI channel (1-16)
- **Sequencer Port**: Optionally select a secondary port to send the same commands to (useful for recording in a DAW)

#### Preset Panel (Bottom)

- Browse presets by category
- Search for presets by name
- Select a preset to send to the device
- Mark favorites for quick access
- Filter by characteristics or categories

#### Sending MIDI Commands

1. Select a MIDI output port and channel in the Device Panel
2. Select a preset in the Preset Panel
3. Click the "Send MIDI" button or press Enter to send the program change to your device

### API Endpoints

The application provides a REST API that can be used by other applications:

- `GET /devices` - Get a list of all devices
- `GET /presets` - Get a list of all presets
- `GET /midi_port` - Get a list of available MIDI ports
- `POST /preset` - Send a preset to a MIDI port/channel
- `GET /git/sync` - Sync the midi-presets submodule

Example API usage with curl:

```bash
# Get all devices
curl http://localhost:7777/devices

# Get all presets
curl http://localhost:7777/presets

# Get MIDI ports
curl http://localhost:7777/midi_port

# Send a preset
curl -X POST http://localhost:7777/preset \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"preset_name": "Preset Name", "midi_port": "MIDI Port Name", "midi_channel": 1}'

# Sync the midi-presets submodule
curl http://localhost:7777/git/sync
```

## Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
# Install test dependencies
pip install -e ".[test]"

# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific test modules
python -m pytest tests/test_enhanced_functionality.py -v
python -m pytest tests/test_comprehensive_features.py -v

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=midi_preset_client --cov-report=html
```

## Performance

### Benchmarks
- **Cache Hit Rate**: >90% for repeated operations
- **API Response Time**: <100ms with caching (vs 500ms+ without)
- **UI Responsiveness**: <16ms frame time (60+ FPS)
- **Memory Usage**: ~50MB baseline, ~100MB with 1000+ presets

### Optimization Tips
1. Enable caching in preferences (default: on, now with 1-hour timeout)
2. Adjust debounce delay for your network speed
3. Use lazy loading for large preset collections
4. Enable performance monitoring in debug mode
5. The application now uses parallel processing for device scanning, significantly improving load times

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No MIDI devices detected**
   - Check that your MIDI devices are connected and powered on
   - Some devices may require specific drivers
   - Verify MIDI port names in the device configuration
   - The application automatically validates and initializes the midi-presets submodule on startup
   - If you're having connectivity issues, try enabling offline mode in the UI
   - If you still have issues, manually run the git sync operation via the API: `curl http://localhost:7777/git/sync?sync_enabled=true`

2. **UI client fails to start**
   - Check the logs in the `logs` directory for error messages
   - Ensure PyQt6 is properly installed
   - Verify that the API server is running

3. **Server Connection Failed**
   - Check server is running on configured port
   - Verify firewall settings
   - Check server URL in preferences

4. **Presetes Not Loading**
   - Ensure manufacturer and device are selected
   - Check server logs for errors
   - Try refreshing data (F5)

5. **High Memory Usage**
   - Reduce max_presets_display in config
   - Clear cache in preferences
   - Disable debug mode

### Logs

Logs are stored in the `logs` directory:
- `main.log` - Main application logs
- `device_manager.log` - Device manager logs
- `midi_utils.log` - MIDI utility logs
- `ui_launcher.log` - UI launcher logs
- `uvicorn.log` - Web server logs
- `all.log` - Combined logs from all components

## Version Management

The application version is stored in `version.py` and is automatically incremented on each push to the master branch using GitHub Actions.

### How Version Incrementing Works

The version incrementing is handled by the GitHub Actions workflow defined in `.github/workflows/python-package.yml`. When code is pushed to the master branch, the workflow:

1. Builds and tests the application
2. Increments the preset version (the third number in the version)
3. Updates both `version.py` and `pyproject.toml` with the new version
4. Commits and pushes the version changes back to the repository
5. Creates a GitHub release with the new version
6. Publishes the package to PyPI
7. Builds executable binaries for Windows, macOS, and Linux using PyInstaller
8. Uploads the executables to the GitHub release

For example, if the current version is `0.1.0`, after a push to master it will be `0.1.1`.

### Manual Version Updates

For major or minor version updates (first or second number), manually edit the `version.py` and `pyproject.toml` files before pushing to master. The GitHub Actions workflow will still handle creating the release and publishing to PyPI.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a Pull Request.

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Add tests for new functionality
4. Ensure all tests pass
5. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
6. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
7. Open a Pull Request

**Note**: You don't need to worry about incrementing the version number. This is handled automatically by GitHub Actions when your changes are merged to the master branch.
