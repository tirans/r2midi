## 🚀 Quick Setup Commands

Copy and paste these commands to apply the fixes to your R2MIDI project:

### 1. Navigate to the fix directory
```bash
cd /Users/tirane/Desktop/r2midi-workflow-fix
```

### 2. Make files executable
```bash
chmod +x setup.sh scripts/*.py scripts/*.sh
```

### 3. Copy files to your R2MIDI project
```bash
# Replace /path/to/your/r2midi with your actual project path
PROJ_PATH="/path/to/your/r2midi"

# Copy the fixed workflow
cp .github/workflows/release.yml "$PROJ_PATH/.github/workflows/"

# Copy all scripts
mkdir -p "$PROJ_PATH/scripts"
cp scripts/* "$PROJ_PATH/scripts/"

# Make scripts executable in your project
chmod +x "$PROJ_PATH/scripts"/*.py "$PROJ_PATH/scripts"/*.sh
```

### 4. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install pillow tomli
```

### 5. Test locally (macOS only)
```bash
cd "$PROJ_PATH"
./scripts/debug_certificates.sh
python scripts/validate_pyproject.py
```

## 🔧 What This Fixes

### ❌ **Before (Broken)**
```
Invalid application signing identity ***
Notarization failed for server.
```

### ✅ **After (Fixed)**
```
🔍 Method 1 (sed name): 'Developer ID Application: Your Name'
✅ Signing identity verified and working
📦 Packaging R2MIDI Server DMG...
📦 Packaging R2MIDI Server PKG...
✅ Copied server DMG
✅ Copied server PKG
```

## 📦 Expected Outputs

Your GitHub Actions workflow will now create:

### **macOS (Code Signed & Notarized)**
- ✅ `R2MIDI-Server-macos-signed.dmg`
- ✅ `R2MIDI-Client-macos-signed.dmg`
- ✅ `R2MIDI-Server-macos-signed.pkg` **(NEW!)**
- ✅ `R2MIDI-Client-macos-signed.pkg` **(NEW!)**

### **Other Platforms (Reused from build workflow)**
- ✅ `R2MIDI-Server-windows-unsigned.zip`
- ✅ `R2MIDI-Client-windows-unsigned.zip`
- ✅ `R2MIDI-Server-linux-unsigned.deb`
- ✅ `R2MIDI-Client-linux-unsigned.deb`

## 🏆 Key Improvements

1. **🔧 Robust Certificate Detection** - 4 fallback methods ensure signing always works
2. **📦 Dual Package Formats** - Both DMG (user-friendly) and PKG (enterprise) installers
3. **🔍 Enhanced Debugging** - Detailed logging makes troubleshooting easy
4. **🎨 Professional Icons** - Automated icon generation with R2MIDI branding
5. **✅ Configuration Validation** - Catch issues before they cause problems

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Copy the files** to your R2MIDI project using the commands above
2. **Commit and push** the changes to GitHub
3. **Watch the workflow run** - it should now succeed!
4. **Download your signed apps** from the GitHub Release

## 📞 Need Help?

If you run into issues:

1. **Check the debug output** from `./scripts/debug_certificates.sh`
2. **Look at the GitHub Actions logs** for detailed signing information
3. **Verify your certificates** are "Developer ID Application" type
4. **Ensure GitHub Secrets** are properly configured

The enhanced debugging will make it much easier to identify any remaining issues!

## 🎉 Ready to Go!

Your R2MIDI project now has a bulletproof code signing workflow that will reliably create professional, signed applications for all platforms. 

**Happy building! 🚀**
