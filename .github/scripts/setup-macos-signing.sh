GitHub Repository Secrets for R2MIDI macOS Signing
==================================================

Add these secrets to your GitHub repository:
Go to: Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > New repository secret

CRITICAL: Copy these values EXACTLY as shown below.

Secret Name: APPLE_DEVELOPER_ID_APPLICATION_CERT
Secret Value:
$app_cert_base64

Secret Name: APPLE_DEVELOPER_ID_INSTALLER_CERT
Secret Value:
$installer_cert_base64

Secret Name: APPLE_CERT_PASSWORD
Secret Value:
$cert_password

Secret Name: APPLE_ID
Secret Value:
$apple_id

Secret Name: APPLE_ID_PASSWORD
Secret Value:
$app_password

Secret Name: APPLE_TEAM_ID
Secret Value:
$team_id

Setup Instructions:
==================

1. Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/[your-username]/r2midi
2. Click: Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
3. For each secret above:
   - Click "New repository secret"
   - Enter the exact Secret Name
   - Paste the exact Secret Value
   - Click "Add secret"

4. Verify all 6 secrets are added:
   ‚úÖ APPLE_DEVELOPER_ID_APPLICATION_CERT
   ‚úÖ APPLE_DEVELOPER_ID_INSTALLER_CERT
   ‚úÖ APPLE_CERT_PASSWORD
   ‚úÖ APPLE_ID
   ‚úÖ APPLE_ID_PASSWORD
   ‚úÖ APPLE_TEAM_ID

Testing Your Setup:
==================

After adding secrets:
1. Push a commit to trigger the macOS build workflow
2. Check GitHub Actions for build success
3. Look for signed .dmg and .pkg files in artifacts

OpenSSL Compatibility:
====================

Your certificates use RC2-40-CBC encryption (common with Keychain Access exports).
The updated scripts automatically handle OpenSSL 3.x compatibility using the legacy provider.

Certificate Details:
==================

Application Certificate: Developer ID Application
- Purpose: Sign macOS applications for distribution outside Mac App Store
- Used by: codesign command

Installer Certificate: Developer ID Installer  
- Purpose: Sign PKG installers for distribution outside Mac App Store
- Used by: productsign command

Security Notes:
==============

- These secrets provide access to your Apple Developer certificates
- Only add them to repositories you trust completely
- Regenerate app-specific password if compromised
- Store this file securely and delete after GitHub setup
- Never commit certificate files to git

Generated: $(date)
Valid until: [Check certificate expiration in Keychain Access]
