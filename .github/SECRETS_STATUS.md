# ✅ GitHub Secrets Configuration - Ready to Use!

## Current Secret Mapping Status

I've verified that your GitHub Actions workflows are **already correctly configured** to use your existing GitHub secrets. Here's the mapping:

### 🍎 **Apple Developer ID Signing** (Currently Used)
```yaml
# Secrets Used in Workflows:
APPLE_CERTIFICATE_P12           ✅ Used in reusable-build.yml, macos-native.yml
APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD     ✅ Used in reusable-build.yml, macos-native.yml  
APPLE_ID                       ✅ Used in reusable-build.yml, macos-native.yml
APPLE_ID_PASSWORD             ✅ Used in reusable-build.yml, macos-native.yml
APPLE_TEAM_ID                 ✅ Used in reusable-build.yml, macos-native.yml
```

### 🏪 **App Store Connect** (Currently Used)
```yaml
# Secrets Used in app-store.yml:
APPLE_APP_STORE_CERTIFICATE_P12        ✅ Used in app-store.yml
APPLE_APP_STORE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD   ✅ Used in app-store.yml
APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY              ✅ Used in app-store.yml
APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID            ✅ Used in app-store.yml
APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEY_ID               ✅ Used in app-store.yml
```

### 📱 **App Metadata** (Currently Used)
```yaml
# Secrets Used in macos-native.yml:
APP_BUNDLE_ID_PREFIX          ✅ Used in configure-build action
APP_DISPLAY_NAME_SERVER       ✅ Used in configure-build action
APP_DISPLAY_NAME_CLIENT       ✅ Used in configure-build action
APP_AUTHOR_NAME              ✅ Used in configure-build action
APP_AUTHOR_EMAIL             ✅ Used in configure-build action
```

### 🔑 **Publishing & CI/CD** (Currently Used)
```yaml
# Secrets Used in workflows:
GITHUB_TOKEN                 ✅ Used in release.yml (GitHub releases)
# PYPI_API_TOKEN              🔄 Available but using OIDC (see note below)
```

### 🪟 **Windows Signing** (Available - Need to Enable)
```yaml
# Available but not yet used:
WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE_P12      🟡 Available but not implemented
WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD 🟡 Available but not implemented
```

## ✅ What's Working Now

Your workflows are **immediately ready to use** with proper signing and notarization:

1. **✅ macOS Developer ID Builds** - Fully configured for production signing
2. **✅ App Store Builds** - Ready for App Store submission
3. **✅ Cross-platform Builds** - Linux, Windows, macOS support
4. **✅ GitHub Releases** - Automatic release creation
5. **✅ PyPI Publishing** - Using OIDC trusted publishing

## 🔄 Optional Enhancements Available

### 1. **Windows Code Signing** (Recommended)
Since you have Windows signing certificates, I can add Windows code signing support:

```yaml
# Would use these existing secrets:
WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE_P12
WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD
```

### 2. **PyPI Token Authentication** (Alternative)
Currently using OIDC, but you have `PYPI_API_TOKEN` available as fallback:

```yaml
# Current: OIDC trusted publishing (more secure)
# Alternative: Token-based (uses PYPI_API_TOKEN secret)
```

## 🚀 Ready to Test!

Your current setup should work immediately:

1. **Development Builds** (Fast, unsigned):
   ```bash
   # Trigger via push to develop branch or manual dispatch
   # Uses: No signing secrets (faster builds)
   ```

2. **Production Builds** (Signed & Notarized):
   ```bash
   # Trigger via push to master or manual dispatch
   # Uses: All Apple signing secrets automatically
   ```

3. **App Store Builds**:
   ```bash
   # Manual dispatch from Actions tab
   # Uses: App Store Connect secrets automatically
   ```

## 🛠️ Windows Signing Enhancement

Would you like me to add Windows code signing support? I can update the build process to:

- ✅ Sign Windows executables with your certificate
- ✅ Add timestamping for long-term validity
- ✅ Create signed MSI installers
- ✅ Verify signatures automatically

This would use your existing `WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE_P12` and `WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` secrets.

## 📋 Summary

**Current Status**: ✅ **READY TO USE**
- All existing workflows correctly reference your GitHub secrets
- macOS signing and notarization fully configured
- App Store builds ready
- Cross-platform builds supported
- No changes needed to secret names or workflow files

**Optional Additions**:
- 🪟 Windows code signing (uses existing secrets)
- 🐍 PyPI token fallback (uses existing secret)

Your GitHub Actions are ready to create professional, signed, and notarized applications immediately! 🎉

**Test Command**:
```bash
git push origin master  # Triggers full production build with signing
```
