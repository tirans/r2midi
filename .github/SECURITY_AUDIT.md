# üîê Security Audit Report: GitHub Actions Workflows

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the R2MIDI GitHub Actions workflows to ensure **no secrets, passwords, or sensitive information** are exposed in this open source project.

## üö® Security Issues Fixed

### 1. Certificate Password Exposure
**Issue**: Certificate passwords could be exposed in error logs when import commands fail.

**Fix**: 
- Added `echo "::add-mask::$PASSWORD"` to mask passwords in logs
- Redirected output to `/dev/null 2>&1` to suppress error messages
- Added proper error handling with generic error messages

```bash
# BEFORE (vulnerable)
security import cert.p12 -k keychain -P "$PASSWORD" -T /usr/bin/codesign

# AFTER (secure)
echo "::add-mask::$PASSWORD"
security import cert.p12 -k keychain -P "$PASSWORD" -T /usr/bin/codesign >/dev/null 2>&1
```

### 2. API Key and Credential Masking
**Issue**: App Store Connect API keys and other credentials could appear in logs.

**Fix**: 
- Masked all sensitive environment variables
- Removed API key paths from environment variables
- Suppressed verbose output from Apple tools

```bash
# Added masking for all sensitive values
echo "::add-mask::$APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY"
echo "::add-mask::$APPLE_ID"
echo "::add-mask::$APPLE_TEAM_ID"
```

### 3. Windows Certificate Password Security
**Issue**: PowerShell signtool could expose passwords in error output.

**Fix**:
- Added PowerShell masking with `Write-Host "::add-mask::$password"`
- Wrapped signing in try-catch blocks
- Suppressed signtool verbose output

### 4. Notarization Credential Protection
**Issue**: Apple ID credentials could leak during notarization.

**Fix**:
- Masked Apple ID and app-specific passwords
- Redirected notarytool output to prevent credential exposure
- Added proper error handling

## ‚úÖ Security Measures Implemented

### Input Sanitization
- ‚úÖ All secrets are masked using GitHub's `::add-mask::` directive
- ‚úÖ Command output is suppressed for sensitive operations
- ‚úÖ Error messages are generic and don't reveal secret values

### Output Protection
- ‚úÖ No secrets are ever echo'd to logs or console
- ‚úÖ Certificate details and API keys are not displayed
- ‚úÖ Temporary files are securely cleaned up

### Environment Security
- ‚úÖ Sensitive environment variables are masked
- ‚úÖ API key paths don't expose Key IDs unnecessarily
- ‚úÖ Bundle IDs and app names are safe to expose (not sensitive)

### Command Security
- ‚úÖ All certificate import commands suppress output
- ‚úÖ Code signing operations hide sensitive parameters
- ‚úÖ App Store submission tools run with minimal output

## üîç Security Verification Checklist

### ‚úÖ Secrets Management
- [ ] All GitHub secrets properly configured in repository settings
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in workflow files
- [ ] All sensitive environment variables masked
- [ ] Secrets only accessed through `${{ secrets.* }}` syntax

### ‚úÖ Log Protection  
- [ ] No passwords visible in workflow logs
- [ ] No certificate data exposed in output
- [ ] No API keys or tokens logged
- [ ] Error messages don't reveal secret values

### ‚úÖ Temporary File Security
- [ ] Certificate files (.p12) are deleted after use
- [ ] API key files have restricted permissions (600)
- [ ] Temporary directories cleaned up properly
- [ ] No sensitive data left in build artifacts

### ‚úÖ Command Output Security
- [ ] Certificate import commands suppress output
- [ ] Code signing operations hide parameters
- [ ] API calls suppress verbose logging
- [ ] Tool errors don't expose credentials

## üõ°Ô∏è Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Principle of Least Exposure
- Only essential information is logged
- Sensitive operations run with minimal output
- Generic error messages protect secret details

### 2. Defense in Depth
- Multiple layers of protection for each secret type
- Both input masking and output suppression
- Proper cleanup of temporary sensitive files

### 3. Fail-Safe Defaults
- Operations fail securely without exposing secrets
- Missing credentials result in safe skips, not errors
- Generic error messages for all failure types

### 4. Audit Trail
- All security measures documented and reviewable
- Clear separation of public and private information
- Transparent about what information is safe to expose

## üìã Safe vs Sensitive Information

### ‚úÖ Safe to Expose (Public Information)
```
- Repository name and URL
- Bundle ID prefixes (com.yourcompany)
- App display names (R2MIDI Server)
- Author names and public emails
- Version numbers and build info
- Platform names and build status
- Generic error messages
```

### üîí Must Protect (Sensitive Information)
```
- Certificate passwords
- Apple ID passwords (app-specific)
- App Store Connect API keys
- Certificate .p12 file contents
- Apple Team IDs and Issuer IDs
- Windows certificate passwords
- Keychain passwords
- API key file paths with Key IDs
```

## üîß GitHub Actions Security Features Used

### 1. Secret Masking
```yaml
# Automatic masking in workflow logs
echo "::add-mask::${{ secrets.SENSITIVE_VALUE }}"
```

### 2. Environment Protection
```yaml
# Requires approval for sensitive environments
environment: production
```

### 3. Output Suppression
```bash
# Redirect to prevent sensitive output
command >/dev/null 2>&1
```

### 4. Conditional Execution
```yaml
# Only run when secrets are available
if: secrets.CERTIFICATE != ''
```

## üöÄ Safe Open Source Usage

This workflow system is now **100% safe for open source projects** because:

1. **No secrets are hardcoded** - All sensitive data comes from GitHub secrets
2. **No secrets are logged** - Comprehensive masking and output suppression
3. **No sensitive data in artifacts** - Build outputs contain no credentials
4. **Graceful degradation** - Missing secrets result in safe skips
5. **Clear security boundaries** - Documented what's public vs private

## üìù Security Maintenance

### Regular Audits
- Review workflow logs for any exposed sensitive information
- Verify all new secrets are properly masked
- Test failure scenarios to ensure no secret leakage

### Secret Rotation
- Rotate app-specific passwords annually
- Update certificates before expiration
- Regenerate API keys if compromised

### Access Control
- Limit repository admin access
- Use environment protection for production secrets
- Monitor secret access through GitHub audit logs
