# ✅ GitHub Actions & Secrets Integration Complete!

## Summary of Changes Made

I've updated your GitHub Actions workflows to use your existing GitHub secrets and added **Windows code signing support**. Everything is now ready to use with your current secret configuration.

## 🔄 **Updates Applied**

### ✅ **1. Verified Secret Integration**
All workflows already correctly reference your existing secrets:

```yaml
# ✅ Already Correctly Configured:
APPLE_CERTIFICATE_P12           # Used in macOS signing
APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD     # Used in macOS signing
APPLE_ID                       # Used in notarization
APPLE_ID_PASSWORD             # Used in notarization
APPLE_TEAM_ID                 # Used in notarization
APPLE_APP_STORE_CERTIFICATE_P12        # Used in App Store builds
APPLE_APP_STORE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD   # Used in App Store builds
APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY              # Used in App Store submission
APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID            # Used in App Store submission
APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEY_ID               # Used in App Store submission
APP_BUNDLE_ID_PREFIX          # Used in app configuration
APP_DISPLAY_NAME_SERVER       # Used in app branding
APP_DISPLAY_NAME_CLIENT       # Used in app branding
APP_AUTHOR_NAME              # Used in app metadata
APP_AUTHOR_EMAIL             # Used in app metadata
GITHUB_TOKEN                 # Used in releases
```

### ✅ **2. Added Windows Code Signing Support**
**NEW**: Your `WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE_P12` and `WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` secrets are now being used!

```yaml
# 🆕 NOW ACTIVE:
WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE_P12      # Added to Windows builds
WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD # Added to Windows builds
```

**Features Added:**
- ✅ Windows executable signing with timestamping
- ✅ Certificate verification and validation
- ✅ Automatic discovery and signing of .exe files
- ✅ Production-grade Windows code signing pipeline

### ✅ **3. Enhanced Build Matrix**
Updated production builds to include signing for both Windows and macOS:

```yaml
# Before:
- platform: windows
  os: windows-latest
- platform: macOS
  os: macos-13
  sign: true

# After:
- platform: windows
  os: windows-latest
  sign: true      # 🆕 Windows signing enabled
- platform: macOS
  os: macos-13
  sign: true      # ✅ macOS signing already working
```
