# macOS Code Signing Issue - Solution Summary

## Issue Description

The macOS build process was failing during code signing with the error:
```
Unable to code sign /Users/tirane/Desktop/r2midi/build/server/macos/app/R2MIDI Server.app
```

The root cause was that briefcase was falling back to ad-hoc signing (`--sign -`) but trying to use entitlements that require proper Developer ID Application certificates.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Briefcase Configuration Issue**: Despite having a valid Developer ID Application certificate available in the keychain, briefcase was not recognizing it and falling back to ad-hoc signing.

2. **Incompatible Entitlements**: The original `entitlements.plist` contained entitlements that cannot be used with ad-hoc signing:
   - `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation`
   - `com.apple.security.cs.allow-jit`
   - `com.apple.security.cs.allow-unsigned-executable-memory`

3. **PyQt6 Framework Issues**: Even with ad-hoc signing, PyQt6 frameworks were causing signing failures due to their complex structure and requirements.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Dynamic Entitlements Selection (`scripts/select_entitlements.py`)

Created a script that automatically selects the appropriate entitlements file based on certificate availability:
- Uses `entitlements.plist` when proper certificates are available
- Falls back to `entitlements_adhoc.plist` for ad-hoc signing

### 2. Ad-hoc Compatible Entitlements (`entitlements_adhoc.plist`)

Created a reduced entitlements file that works with ad-hoc signing:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>com.apple.security.network.client</key>
    <true/>
    <key>com.apple.security.network.server</key>
    <true/>
    <key>com.apple.security.device.audio-input</key>
    <true/>
    <key>com.apple.security.device.microphone</key>
    <true/>
    <key>com.apple.security.files.user-selected.read-write</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
</plist>
```

### 3. Briefcase Signing Configuration (`scripts/configure_briefcase_signing.py`)

Created a script that:
- Detects available signing identities in the keychain
- Updates `pyproject.toml` with the specific signing identity
- Ensures briefcase can find and use the correct certificate

### 4. Updated pyproject.toml Configuration

Modified the macOS configuration to use ad-hoc signing with compatible entitlements:

```toml
[tool.briefcase.app.server.macOS]
# macOS specific settings
# Using ad-hoc signing with compatible entitlements to resolve signing issues
# This approach works reliably when proper certificates are not available
# or when briefcase has trouble finding the configured certificates
codesign_identity = "-"
entitlements_file = "entitlements_adhoc.plist"
packaging_format = "dmg,pkg"
sign_app = true
```

### 5. Updated GitHub Actions Workflow

Added a new step in `.github/workflows/build-macos.yml`:

```yaml
- name: üîê Configure signing and entitlements for briefcase
  shell: bash
  run: |
    echo "üîß Configuring signing and entitlements for briefcase..."
    
    # Make scripts executable
    chmod +x scripts/select_entitlements.py
    chmod +x scripts/configure_briefcase_signing.py
    
    # Configure briefcase signing identity
    echo "üîê Setting up briefcase signing identity..."
    python scripts/configure_briefcase_signing.py
    
    # Select appropriate entitlements based on certificate availability
    echo "üîç Selecting appropriate entitlements..."
    python scripts/select_entitlements.py
    
    echo "‚úÖ Briefcase signing and entitlements configuration completed"
```

## Current Status

The implemented solution addresses the core issue of incompatible entitlements with ad-hoc signing. However, there may still be issues with PyQt6 frameworks that require additional investigation.

## Recommendations

### For Production Builds
1. **Use Proper Certificates**: Ensure Developer ID Application certificates are properly installed and accessible to briefcase
2. **Test Certificate Access**: Run the signing configuration scripts to verify certificate detection
3. **Monitor Build Logs**: Check for any remaining signing issues with specific frameworks

### For Development Builds
1. **Use Ad-hoc Signing**: The current configuration with `entitlements_adhoc.plist` should work for development
2. **Consider Framework Alternatives**: If PyQt6 continues to cause issues, consider alternative UI frameworks

### For CI/CD
1. **Certificate Management**: Ensure certificates are properly imported into the keychain during CI runs
2. **Dynamic Configuration**: Use the provided scripts to automatically configure signing based on available certificates
3. **Fallback Strategy**: The current setup provides a reliable fallback to ad-hoc signing when certificates are not available

## Files Modified

1. `pyproject.toml` - Updated macOS signing configuration
2. `entitlements_adhoc.plist` - New ad-hoc compatible entitlements
3. `scripts/select_entitlements.py` - Dynamic entitlements selection
4. `scripts/configure_briefcase_signing.py` - Briefcase signing configuration
5. `fix_briefcase_signing.py` - Comprehensive signing fix script
6. `.github/workflows/build-macos.yml` - Updated CI workflow

## Testing

To test the solution:

1. Run the configuration scripts:
   ```bash
   python scripts/configure_briefcase_signing.py
   python scripts/select_entitlements.py
   ```

2. Attempt a briefcase build:
   ```bash
   briefcase build macos app -a server
   ```

3. Check the build logs for any remaining issues

## Next Steps

If PyQt6 framework signing issues persist, consider:
1. Investigating PyQt6-specific signing requirements
2. Using alternative UI frameworks that have fewer signing complications
3. Implementing framework-specific signing workarounds
4. Consulting PyQt6 documentation for macOS distribution best practices
