fix: macOS code signing extended attributes issue

FIXED: The ditto command was preserving extended attributes by default

Key changes:
- Use `ditto --norsrc --noextattr --noacl` to exclude ALL metadata
- Always use `xattr -rc` (not -cr) for recursive clearing  
- Add path resolution and debugging for GitHub Actions
- Make Python scripts executable in workflow
- Add emergency shell-based cleaner as fallback
- Remove Python cache files that often have xattrs

The cleaning now actually removes ALL extended attributes, fixing the
persistent "resource fork, Finder information, or similar detritus not allowed" error.

Tested solutions:
- Proper ditto flags prevent xattr copying
- Multiple cleanup passes ensure complete removal
- Works in both local and GitHub Actions environments
