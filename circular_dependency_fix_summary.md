# GitHub Actions Circular Dependency Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The "Build and Test" workflow was reporting "This workflow is waiting for Build and Test to complete before running" - indicating a circular dependency where the workflow was waiting for itself.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by duplicate workflow triggers creating a circular dependency:

1. **build.yml** (Build and Test workflow):
   - Triggered by: `push` and `pull_request` to master
   - Calls: `./.github/workflows/ci.yml` via `uses:`

2. **ci.yml** (CI workflow):
   - Triggered by: `push` and `pull_request` to master (DUPLICATE)
   - Also supports: `workflow_call` (for being called by other workflows)

### The Problem:
When a push to master occurred:
1. Both `build.yml` and `ci.yml` started independently due to the same triggers
2. `build.yml` also tried to call `ci.yml` via `uses: ./.github/workflows/ci.yml`
3. This created a conflict where the Build and Test workflow was waiting for its called CI workflow to complete
4. But CI was already running independently, causing confusion and circular waiting

## Solution Implemented
Removed the duplicate triggers from `ci.yml` to eliminate the circular dependency:

### Before:
```yaml
on:
  workflow_call:
  push:
    branches: [ master, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master, develop ]
  workflow_dispatch:
    # ... inputs
```

### After:
```yaml
on:
  workflow_call:
  workflow_dispatch:
    # ... inputs
```

## Changes Made
**File**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- **Removed**: `push` and `pull_request` triggers
- **Kept**: `workflow_call` (for being called by build.yml)
- **Kept**: `workflow_dispatch` (for manual triggering)

## Expected Results
1. **No more circular dependency**: CI will only run when called by Build and Test workflow
2. **Clear workflow execution**: Build and Test workflow controls when CI runs
3. **No duplicate CI runs**: CI won't run independently and via workflow call simultaneously
4. **Proper workflow completion**: Build and Test workflow will proceed normally after CI completes

## Workflow Flow After Fix
```
Push/PR to master → Build and Test workflow starts
                 ↓
                 Calls CI workflow (workflow_call)
                 ↓
                 CI completes
                 ↓
                 Build and Test continues with build jobs
```

## Files Modified
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: Removed duplicate triggers to prevent circular dependency

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test with a push to master to verify Build and Test workflow completes normally
2. Test with a pull request to verify the workflow flow works correctly
3. Verify that CI can still be triggered manually via workflow_dispatch if needed
4. Monitor that no workflows get stuck in "waiting" state

## Technical Details
This fix ensures that:
- Only the Build and Test workflow responds to push/PR events
- CI workflow only runs when explicitly called by Build and Test
- No competing or duplicate workflow executions occur
- Clear dependency chain: Build and Test → CI → Build jobs
