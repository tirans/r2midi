# 🛠️ Git Hooks Fix Applied

## 🔍 Issue Identified

The pre-commit hook was not preventing commits of the `server/midi-presets` directory itself, only files within it. This caused issues when trying to commit changes that included the directory as a tracked file.

## ✅ Changes Made

1. **Modified pre-commit hook** to check for three conditions:
   - If the `/server/midi-presets` directory itself is being committed
   - If any files in the staging area are from the `/server/midi-presets` directory (except for `.gitkeep` and `README.md` files)
   - If the `.gitmodules` file contains a reference to the midi-presets submodule

2. **Updated documentation** in:
   - `GIT_HOOKS.md` - Added explicit mention of preventing the directory itself from being committed
   - `HOOK_TESTING.md` - Added a new test case for this scenario
   - `README.md` - Updated the description of the Git hooks

3. **Created test script** (`test-hook.sh`) to verify the fix works correctly

## 🧪 Testing

The fix was tested by:
1. Running the `test-hook.sh` script, which:
   - Creates the server/midi-presets directory
   - Attempts to stage the directory itself
   - Runs the pre-commit hook manually
   - Verifies that the hook prevents the commit with the appropriate error message

## 🔄 How to Use

No additional steps are required. The pre-commit hook will now automatically prevent committing:
- The `server/midi-presets` directory itself
- Files within the directory (except for `.gitkeep` and `README.md`)
- The `.gitmodules` file with references to the midi-presets submodule

To install the hooks, run:
```bash
./install-hooks.sh
```

## 📝 Summary

This fix ensures that the Git hooks properly prevent any form of committing the midi-presets directory to the repository, whether as individual files or as the directory itself, while still allowing the necessary `.gitkeep` and `README.md` files to be committed.
